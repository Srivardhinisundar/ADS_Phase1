Sales Prediction Project README
Project Overview
This repository contains code and resources for a sales prediction
project. The goal of this project is to predict future sales for a given
product or set of products, based on historical sales data and various
features. This README provides an overview of the project, its
structure, and how to use the code and data.

Setup

To set up the environment and run the code, follow these steps:
1. Clone this repository to your local machine:
git clone &lt;repository-url&gt;
2. Install the required dependencies:
pip install -r requirements.txt
[Optional] If you are using external data sources, download or set
up those datasets as instructed in the data section.
Usage
 The main code for data preprocessing, model training, and
prediction can be found in the src directory.
 To train the model, run the training script:
python src/train.py
To make sales predictions, run the prediction script:
python src/predict.py
Modify the configuration and hyperparameters in the config
directory to customize the training and prediction process.
Model
This project uses a machine learning model to make sales
predictions. You can find details about the model architecture and
implementation in the model directory.

Results
A summary of the project&#39;s results, including model performance
and any visualizations, can be found in the results directory.
Additionally, you can refer to the Jupyter notebooks in the

notebooks directory for more detailed analysis and
visualizations.
